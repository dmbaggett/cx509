The cx509 extension essentially wraps a machine-generated pure C X.509
certificate parser. We use asn1c to generate the parser code; the
relevant files reside under

  asn1c/examples/sample.source.PKIX1

and

  asn1c/examples/sample.source.PKCS1

The .c and .h files in these directories have been generated from the
ASN.1 syntax definitions in RFC 5280 (unmodified) and pkcs-1v2-1.asn
(with several modifications). You can get the unmodified ASN.1 module
text from here:
